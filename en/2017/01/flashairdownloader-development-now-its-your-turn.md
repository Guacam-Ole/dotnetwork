# FlashAirDownloader - development: Now it's your turn

Hi,. folks,

I just programmed a small windows service to automatically FlashAir-pictures when I found out **that I lost my FlashAir - card**

So I am not able to test that program anymore. I decided for myself that I need something better than the unstable FlashAir-Cards and bought a camera with WiFi inside. (Just in case you are curious: It is a Sony HX400)

I do **not** publish this as a working download, because I am not able to test it. So there is a big chance that this even breaks the original program. **But** FAD2 is open source, so I checked the code in into the [development-branch on GitHub](https://github.com/OleAlbers/fad2).

So if there is any C# - developer out there who is willing to invest one or two hours to finish that, feel free to do that.

Â 

P.S: No, please don't buy me a new FlashAir :)
