### Things you don't find there

I was born in a *very* small village in western Germany. That kind of village that does not even have traffic lights. But a church. And a pub, of course. I learned all that "computer-stuff" that makes other people think I can repair their TV (spoiler: I can't) with about six years. My father showed me the Video Genie, The Osborne and a lot of other devices that have been awesome then and are old now. Started the classic Basic-Route, then Pascal, C++ and ended up using C# since university. I sometimes do some HTML/CSS/Angular and even PHP stuff but I strictly try to avoid that. So no real expertise there.

Non-Nerdy stuff includes cycling. I especially love to cycle through norway. Just me, my bike, my tent. And a ton of repair tools, of course. I also atended the "CyClassics" (bicylce-race in Hamburg) three times and then retired at the peak (reaching the target somehow) of my sporting career.

I also wrote a book that is NOT about programming, but is about a geek living in Hamburg (currently available in german, french and spanish) called "Alstervergnügen". Most of the time I am in a good mood EXCEPT when the FC St. Pauli loses. 

If you have any questions or something is terribly wrong about the stuff I wrote. There are a few ways to contact me
